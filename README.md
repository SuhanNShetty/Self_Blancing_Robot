# Self Balancing Robot

This is an experimental project that I did under the guidance of Prof.Ashitava Ghosal during my master's studies. The aim of the project was to design and implement a linear controller for a small two-wheeled (under-actuated system) mobile robot. The project involved the following:
- design and prototyping of the two-wheeled mobile robot
- System dynamics modeling
- design of linear controller
- implementation of the controller using a hardware (NI-myRIO) provided by National Instruments
